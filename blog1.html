<h2>Blog 1</h2>
              
<p>It's been a while since I've really written anything. But a journey of 100 blogs must begin with a single shitpost.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm gingerly dipping a toe back into the waters of creation. I'll need to rehydrate slowly, loathing every step of the process - but it's a necessary readjustment after being sucked dry by mindless consumption.</p>

<p>What's my voice sound like? What do I want to say? I don't really know, yet. I have a backlog of topics, but to be honest, most of them would end up becoming summaries of weird wikipedia articles (though, to be honest again, I do love reading that type of thing).</p>
  
<p>Time will tell. Thanks for checking in.
